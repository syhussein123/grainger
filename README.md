# Grainger Prototype

## Progress so far: 
Fariha's code used arrays instead of a database, and added an entry into the array <br><br>
Kyla's code created the tables, and started the menu program options, and implemented super basic search functionality, and ability to add to the database *** <br><br> 

current program has 2 menu options: <br>
- Q - search for a question <br>
This only searches for the exact string, so if worded differently it won't show up

- A - add an entry in the question table (question/answer/grainger item #)
***The only thing with this is, should customer service reps even have this ability? Because they are not exprets? I know tech reps are supposed to fill this out so i think we should take this out
